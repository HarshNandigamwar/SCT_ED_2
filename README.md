## ‚è≥Ô∏è Stopwatch Project

### This is a simple yet functional Stopwatch built using HTML, Tailwind-CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of my Frontend Development Internship at #SkillcraftTechnology. The stopwatch allows users to start, pause, reset, and record lap times, making it a useful tool for measuring and recording time intervals accurately.
